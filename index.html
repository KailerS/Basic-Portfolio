                <p>My name is Kailer Smith. I grew up in Gig Harbor Washington. Since my first 18 years in Washington I have lived in Texas, Illinois, Tennessee, and now Colorado. I graduated from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville with a bachelor degree in business administration. I relized that the sales side of business is not for me and I am excited to pursue a career in the development field.</p>
                <p>One of my biggest accomplishments was playing NCAA D-1 baseball. I grew up playing baseball since I can remember. From playing with my dad in the backyard to having him coach me in little league, then to having coaches who played professionally. It was a journey filled with a lot of struggles and the need for growth. When I graduated high school I was talented but undersized. I saw my friends and teammates get offers to big D-1 schools and I had none. I ended up going to a junior college in El Paso, Texas. I played well my two years there enough to finally get my scholarship offer to play D-1.</p>
                <p>My hobbies include soccer, snowboarding, and video games. I played soccer when I was little but baseball then took over my athletic life. I have joined a few 7v7 leagues and had a great time kicking the ball around again. One big draw of moving to Denver was the ability to snowboard all season. I haven't had the chance to try all the mountains around here but my current favorite mountain is Whistler in B.C. Since my days of playing N64 with my friends my love for video games hasn't faded.</p>
